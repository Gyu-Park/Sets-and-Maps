# Sets 
- HashSet: values are not stored in the order in which the values are inserted into the HashSet.
- LinkedHashSet: values are stored in the order in which the values are inserted into the LinkedHashSet.
- TreeSet: values are sorted when they are inserted into the TreeSet.

Sets are way efficient than arrayList or LinkedList when checking if a value is in a Set and removing values.
